# RPI Calculator

Calculates the NCAA's college basketball Rating Percentage Index (a.k.a., RPI)
for a list of teams and games. This uses the current (as of the 2014-15 season)
version of the formula that was introduced in the 2004-05 season. It gives more
weight to home losses and road wins and less weight to road losses and home
wins.
